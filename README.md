# Working with data.table


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://intro-to-data-science-22-workshop.github.io) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will help you dive into data wrangling with data.tables. Data wrangling is one of the main steps we work on in data science, and efficiency is always the needed approach! data.table allows you to code and operate fast and more efficiently. data.table is very fast and memory efficient while performing file reading and writing, aggregations, updates, range and interval joins etc. on big datasets in R programming.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) Grasp the use cases and strengths of data.table, (2) Understand data.table general semantics, (3) Learn to use data.table across different data wrangling tasks, (4) Practically apply what you learn through exercises, and provide you with useful learning material to conitnue your learning journey!
